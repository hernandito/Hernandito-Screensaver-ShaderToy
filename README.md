# Hernandito-ShaderToy
 Version of Kodi Shader Toy w/ modified shaders. More contemporary shaders.
 
 Edited each of the Shader Files and changed the content for more up-to-date style screensavers. Had to keep old file names since I dont know how to edit the XML coder of the plugin to change the names.
 
 I have also tweaked some of the shaders themselves taken from shadertoy.com. If the orignal pllugin gets updated, one needs to copy over all the files in the/resources/shaders folder.
